# gerbera
FDSN Station and Dataselect web services for ringserver.

gerbera is not a complete implementation of the Station and Dataselect FDSN web services, it simply adds a compatibility layer
to ringserver in order to make it compatible with FDSN WS clients such as Swarm.

Under the hood, gerbera uses DataLink to communicate with ringserver.

Configuration is done in the gerbera.properties file.
